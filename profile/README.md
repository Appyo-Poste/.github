# What is Poste?
Poste is an application that enables users to save and organize social media posts and other helpful websites into folders for personal referencing or sharing with friends. 

Poste consists of a backend server, three main Android, iOS, and PC applications, and a Chrome extension.

The backend server was created using the Django framework and Python for its database functionality. It is configured for seamless deployment through containerization in Docker.

The Android application was developed using JetPack Compose to meet current industry standards for Android application development.

The iOS application was developed in Swift and uses Swift UI to be compatible with the latest iOS versions.

Additionally, Poste has a web application written using the Django framework that allows users to log in on a desktop or any other device with web access. The Chrome extension for Poste works as a helper application to improve User Experience by streamlining the most used features while browsing the web with Chrome-based browsers.

The multi-platform development approach enables our sponsor to reach maximum potential application users.
